Your code looks great for a simple Snake game! However, I noticed a couple of areas where you can make improvements:

1. **Comments**: Adding comments to your code is helpful for yourself and others who might read it later.
You've done a good job with comments, but you could add more detailed explanations for complex parts of the code.

2. **Functionality**: Right now, the game quits when the snake hits the boundary of the screen.
You could add an option to wrap around to the opposite side when the snake hits the boundary, which can make the game more interesting.

3. **Refactoring**: Some parts of your code could be refactored to make it cleaner and more efficient.
For instance, instead of using `game_close` and `game_over` variables, you could combine them into a single variable to represent the game state.

4. **Scalability**: As your game grows, you might want to separate different functionalities into their own functions or classes.
This can make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these improvements, or is there anything else you'd like assistance with?
