Compare with:
{CGPT_Snake}
) ###

Here's a comparison between the two pieces of code:

1. **Libraries Used:**
   - Your code uses the `keyboard` and `PySimpleGUI` libraries, whereas the other code uses `pygame`.

2. **Game Environment:**
   - Your code seems to be a console-based game,
   possibly designed to run in a terminal or command prompt window,
   whereas the other code creates a graphical game window using Pygame.

3. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Both games are based on the concept of a snake that moves around and consumes objects (either food or bonuses).
   - The other code has additional features like handling collisions with walls,
   snake body, and food, whereas your code doesn't handle these aspects explicitly.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Your code uses keyboard inputs to control the snake's movement.
   - The other code also uses keyboard inputs, but it has additional features like
   displaying messages for game over and providing options to play again or quit.

5. **Graphics:**
   - Your code doesn't have graphical elements;
   it uses text-based characters to represent the game environment.
   - The other code utilizes Pygame to create a graphical interface with colors,
   shapes, and text rendering.

6. **Structure and Organization:**
   - Both codes are structured as functions with a main loop (`gameLoop()` in the other code,
   and the while loop in your code) handling the game logic.
   - The other code separates concerns by defining functions for different aspects of the game,
   such as drawing the snake, displaying messages, and handling user input.

7. **Scalability and Extensibility:**
   - The other code seems more scalable and extensible due to its modular structure and use of a
   popular game development library like Pygame, which provides more flexibility for adding
   features, improving performance, and enhancing the user interface.

Overall, both codes implement the basic mechanics of a snake game,
but they differ significantly in their implementation approach and the features they offer.
Your code seems suitable for a simple text-based game,
while the other code provides a more comprehensive and visually appealing gaming experience.
